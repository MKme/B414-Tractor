# B414-Tractor

I needed a tractor for the Project Camp family bush property for moving logs, driveway repair, drainage repair and more.  

Tractors are extremely expensive in rural Ontario and have been for many years.  I started searching for a simple model with loader and settled on the International Harvester B414 diesel made from 1961 to 1966

Most manuals are hoarded for sale only on eBay and Amazon so Im releasign all the information, tutorials and manuals I find right here with the world.  IH wont mind :)

## Valve Adjustment

FarmallParts's channel  has this video that will be very helpful even though he is doing the adjustments on an M. the BD154 is set up in the same way. Both intake and exhaust use a clearance of 0.020" with engine warm. Start with cylinder one ( front of tractor ) find your top dead center mark. then move on in the flowing order , 3,4,2 rotating the engine by 1/2 a turn between each cylinder to find the next TDC. you 364 like my b414 does not have a hand crack hole like the M on the video. I just bump the starter, its tricky at first to stop at the right spot, but once you are a few cylinders in you start to get the feel of start vs where you want it to stop.
